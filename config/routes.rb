  # Sample of named route:
  #   match 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', :as => :purchase

  #     resources :products

  # just remember to delete public/index.html.
  # root :to => 'welcome#index'
  root :to => 'static#home'

  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes"

  # This is a legacy wild controller route that's not recommended for RESTful applications.
  # Note: This route will make all actions in every controller accessible via GET requests.
